Least Change ([least_change.py](least_change.py))
------------
Build a program to calculate change in proper denominations after accepting a starting USD$ value. For example, a starting value of $11.00 would result in (1) $10 and (1) $1 bills. 

Design specs:
- Make use of all common USD$ denominations
- Calculate change using the minimum number of bills and coins necessary
- Assume infinite amounts of each denomination in change machine
- Use a language of your choice and provide source code for review
- Functioning program must be demonstrable to reviewers in some fashion
